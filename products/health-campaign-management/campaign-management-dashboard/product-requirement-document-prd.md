#### Users

1. Country Head: After navigating from the national dashboard and selecting a province/state, the country head can view this page, with aggregated data from all districts.
2. Province-Level (state-level) Head: There can be different province-level heads who may be managing different provinces in the country. They will arrive at this page after clicking on the respective campaign type on the landing page. After logging into the admin panel, the province-head will only see the campaigns listed in the dashboard box at the landing page, which they have been assigned. When they select the campaign by its name, they directly land on the overview page of the campaign dashboard, that is, they will not see the national-level dashboard page.
3. District Head: A province has multiple districts, therefore, there are multiple district heads who might be assigned and managing a single district. The district head will have access to the dashboard data for the district that they have been assigned to, and view the aggregated data just for their district.

#### Description

For the selected campaign, the “Registration & Delivery” section majorly focuses on the data collected by the field-level workers. It shows the status of the campaign at a ground level, in each district and administrative post of the province.

#### Users

1. District head: A province has multiple districts, and hence, there are multiple district heads who might be assigned to and managing a single district. The district head will have access to the dashboard data for the specific district that they have been assigned to, and will view the data just for their district.
2. Country head/National-level user: After navigating from the national dashboard and selecting a province, the country head can view the province-level dashboard with all the collective data of different district and administrative blocks.
3. Province-level head : There can be different province level heads who may be managing different provinces in the country.  Therefore, the province-level manager will have accesst to the dashboard of the province which he/she has been assigned to and managing.

### Campaign < Province/District Level Dashboard < Complaints

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-28 at 11.27.31 AM (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Description

For the selected campaign running for a province, the ‘Complaints’ section shows the data about the complaints that have been generated by the FLWs, supervisors, and warehouse managers at any point of time in the process of an ongoing campaign.

#### Users

1. Country head: After navigating from the national dashboard and selecting a province, the country head can view the province-level dashboard with all the collective data of different district and administrative blocks.
2. Province-level head: There can be different province-level heads who may be managing different provinces in the country. Therefore, the province-level manager will have access to the dashboard of the province which he/she has been assigned to and managing.
3. District head: A province has multiple districts, and therefore, there are multiple district heads who might be assigned to and managing a single province. The district head will have access to the dashboard data for the specific district that they have been assigned to, and will view the data just for their district.

### Campaign < Province/District Level Dashboard < Inventory

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-28 at 11.29.54 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Description

For the selected campaign, the ‘Inventory’ section majorly focuses on the data of how the inventory movement is managed within the warehouses, or is being managed within the internal team.

#### Users

1. Country head/National-level user: After navigating from the national dashboard and selecting a province, the country head can view the province-level dashboard for the selected campaign with all the collective data of different districts and administrative blocks.
2. Province-level head: There can be different province-level heads who may be managing different provinces in the country. Therefore, the province level manager will have access to the dashboard of the province which he/she has been assigned to and is managing.
3. District head: A province has multiple districts, and therefore, there are multiple district heads who might be assigned and managing a single district. The district head will have access to the dashboard data for the specific district that they have been assigned to, and will view the data just for his/her district.

### Campaign < Province/District Level Dashboard < Supervision

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-28 at 11.32.12 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Description

This is the campaign-level dashboard for a province/district. The user can view the overall analytics of the activities that the supervisor performs. This supervision dashboard does not have any of the drill-down approaches available for any of the graphs.

#### Users

1. Country head: After navigating from the national dashboard and selecting a campaign for the province, the country head can view the province-level dashboard with all the collective data of different district and administrative blocks.
2. Province-level head: There can be different province-level heads who may be managing different provinces in the country. Therefore, the province-level manager will have an excess of the dashboard of the province to which he/she has been assigned to, and managing. After logging into the admin panel, at the landing page, the province head will only see the campaigns listed in the dashboard box which they have been assigned to. When they select the campaign by its name, they directly land on the overview page of the campaign dashboard, that is, they will not see the national-level dashboard page.
3. District head: A province has multiple districts, and therefore, there are multiple district heads who might be assigned and managing a single district. The district head will have access to the dashboard data for the district that they have been assigned, and will view the data just for their district.
