# Dashboard User Manual

The Dashboard of the health campaign platform has an array of features that provide a comprehensive view of campaign performance, enabling supervisors to monitor their teams with ease, evaluate campaign progression, and troubleshoot any roadblocks. With the Dashboard, campaign supervisors gain real-time insights into the effectiveness of their teams, allowing them to make data-driven decisions to optimise campaign performance. Through intuitive visualisations and customisable metrics, supervisors can easily track key performance indicators (KPIs), such as campaign coverage, engagement, and inventory movement. The Dashboard also provides a holistic view of team productivity and individual performance, empowering supervisors to identify top performers and areas that may require additional support.
