## Setup Guide

Database (DB) Restore (Providing a DB backup to avoid hassle since the automation of the seed data creation is a work in progress):

To restore the database, we are providing the DB dump file. Use the following link to download the SQL file:&#x20;

### Steps to Restore Database Data:

* Run Kubectl, and copy cmd to copy the file to the server (playground pod where DB runs).
* Execute the restore command inside the playground pod.

{% hint style="info" %}
psql -h {host} -U {username} -d {dbname} -f /path/in/pod/seed\_data.sql
{% endhint %}

#### Note:&#x20;

* Once the DB is restored, redeploy the MDMS service, persister, and indexer services using the config flag since we have updated a few links in the DevOps repository.&#x20;
* The Postgres version should be 14.8 or later.

{% hint style="info" %}
kubectl apply -f /path/to/your/pod-config.yaml
{% endhint %}

## Front Line Worker App Setup

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to clone and run the Health Campaign Field Worker App locally on your machine. The Field Worker App is a Flutter application developed for health campaigns.

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your PC:

* Flutter 3.10.0 version: [Flutter SDK. ](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/archive?tab=macos)
* Android Studio or VS Code, any preferred IDE for Flutter development.
* Android device or emulator for testing.
* Run the flutter doctor command to ensure all the required checklists are marked.&#x20;

### Steps to Run the Application

1. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

&#x20;        git clone https://github.com/egovernments/health-campaign-field-worker-app.git

&#x20;        cd health-campaign-field-worker-app

&#x20;  Product Repo: [egovernments/health-campaign-field-worker-app](https://github.com/egovernments/health-campaign-field-worker-app)

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (Android Studio, Visual Studio Code). Make sure that your IDE is configured with the Flutter and Dart plugins.
3. Run install\_bricks.sh bash script which is located in the tools folder.&#x20;
4. Navigate to the root folder of the project in the terminal and run the following command to initialise the packages using Melos:

&#x20;       melos bootstrap&#x20;

&#x20;       (-or-)

&#x20;      melos bs

&#x20;This command fetches and links all the necessary dependencies for the project.

5. Now, create a .env file inside the apps/health\_campaign\_field\_worker\_app  folder.

&#x20;      Sample .env file:&#x20;

```
BASE_URL={replace with base url}
MDMS_API_PATH="egov-mdms-service/v1/_search"
TENANT_ID="default"
SYNC_DOWN_RETRY_COUNT="3"
RETRY_TIME_INTERVAL="5"
CONNECT_TIMEOUT="120000"
RECEIVE_TIMEOUT="120000"
SEND_TIMEOUT="120000"
```

6. Create another file as pubspec\_overrides.yaml in the same folder:

```
# melos_managed_dependency_overrides: digit_components,digit_firebase_services,forms_engine,intl, digit_showcase
dependency_overrides:
 digit_components:
   path: ..\\..\\packages\\digit_components
 digit_firebase_services:
   path: ..\\..\\packages\\digit_firebase_services
 digit_showcase:
   path: ..\\..\\packages\\digit_showcase
 forms_engine:
   path: ..\\..\\packages\\forms_engine
 intl: ^0.18.0
```

Note: Check all the folder names should be present in the packages folder before overriding the dependencies.

7.  Navigate to the app's folder from the terminal:

    cd apps/health\_campaign\_field\_worker\_app
8.  Connect your Android device or start an emulator. Ensure that it is visible by running

    flutter devices.
9.  Now, run the following command to launch the app:

    flutter run

    \
    This command will build the app and install it on the connected device or emulator.

## Steps to Generate APK

* Create a .env file inside the apps/health\_campaign\_field\_worker\_app folder.&#x20;

&#x20;      Sample .env file:

```
BASE_URL="https://health-demo.digit.org/"
MDMS_API_PATH="egov-mdms-service/v1/_search"
TENANT_ID="default"
SYNC_DOWN_RETRY_COUNT="3"
RETRY_TIME_INTERVAL="5"
CONNECT_TIMEOUT="120000"
RECEIVE_TIMEOUT="120000"
SEND_TIMEOUT="120000"
ENV_NAME="UAT"
```

*   Navigate to the root folder of the project in the terminal and run the following command:

    melos clean

    melos bs
*   After successfully running melos bs, navigate to the apps/health\_campaign\_field\_worker\_app folder in the terminal and run the following command to generate the APK:

    flutter build apk --release

    How to Change the Master Data:\
    All the Master data persist in MDMS under tenant folders.

## Upserting Localisation

Import the following curl in Postman:

#### Note: &#x20;

* Replace the {URL} with the required environment.
* Get the {authToken} of SUPER\_USER.
* Replace the {tenantId} with the required tenant.
* Each message object should have a unique code and module.

Sample message to upsert:

```
{
            "code": "ADMINISTRATION_UNIT_FORM_LABEL",
            "message": "Administrative Unit",
            "module": "hcm-beneficiary",
            "locale": "en_MZ"
      }
```

API curl:

```
curl --location '{URL}/localization/messages/v1/_upsert' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "RequestInfo": {
        "apiId": "emp",
        "ver": "1.0",
        "ts": "10-03-2017 00:00:00",
        "action": "create",
        "did": "1",
        "key": "abcdkey",
        "msgId": "20170310130900",

        "authToken": "{authToken}",
        "userInfo": {
            "id": 128
        }
    },
    "tenantId": "{tenantId}",
    "locale": "{locale}", // Eg. en_MZ
    "module": "hcm-common",
    "messages": [
        {
            "code": "ADMINISTRATION_UNIT_FORM_LABEL",
            "message": "Administrative Unit",
            "module": "hcm-beneficiary",
            "locale": "en_MZ"
