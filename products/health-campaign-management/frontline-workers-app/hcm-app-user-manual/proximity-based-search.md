# Proximity-Based Search

At time of registration and drug delivery, the product captures the latitudinal and longitudinal data and the distributor can search for the registered beneficiaries based on the distance from their current location. All the registered beneficiaries are populated based on the distance in an ascending order. The search populates all the beneficiaries registered in a 3-km radius from the current location of the distributor.
