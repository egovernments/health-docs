# Tracking Side-Effects for Beneficiaries

A distributor can record the side-effects experienced by a beneficiary after consuming the drug. The list of side-effects can be configured based on the specific campaign being conducted.

## Key Features

* Allows administrators to record side-effects for drugs delivered to the beneficiaries after every dose consumed by the beneficiary.
* The distributor can record the side-effects for both direct delivery where all the doses of the drug is administered directly to the beneficiary, as well as for indirect delivery where the beneficiary is provided with all the remaining doses by the distributor at the same time and is asked to administer the drug on their own.&#x20;

**If you replied 'No' (Recording side-effects when the the distributor does direct delivery for all rounds):**&#x20;

**Step 1**

After you have completed the delivery for first dose, you will see the list of beneficiaries who are eligible for the next round of drug delivery. If the beneficiary experienced any side-effect, click on the "Unable to Deliver?" button, where you will get 3 options. Here, the last option will be "Record Side Effects".
