# Attendance Management Module

The Attendance Module will allow supervisors to mark attendance for their attendees which will, in turn, help the system maintain the authenticity of records and provide consistent data for payments to the attendees.

## Key Features

Enables supervisors to mark attendance for their attendees in an offline-first manner. The attendance can be marked in 2 ways based on the type of attendance structure chosen by the programme team:

1. Attendance recording once a day.
2. Attendance recording twice a day (Morning and Evening).

#### Step 5:&#x20;

The user can click on the empty circles in front of every attendee and move the state of the attendance from "Not Marked" to 'Present' to 'Absent' on each click of the circle.&#x20;

Once all the attendees have their attendance marked in the register, only then the user can click on submit.&#x20;

If the attendance in a given register is partially marked, the user cannot submit the attendance and will have to click on "Save and Mark Later" which will allow the user to save attendance as a draft for the given register.
