# Multi-Round Campaigns

This enables distributors to deliver multiple doses for multiple cycles, and record the deliveries for the drugs prescribed for that specific cycle.

## Key Features

* Allows a distributor to see the eligible household members for the current cycle under the selected household.
* For each eligible household member, the distributor has two options: Record Delivery and Unable To Deliver.
* A distributor can record the exact quantity delivered for each drug with a delivery comment.
* A distributor can also record if the drugs for the next set of doses in the current cycle are already provided to the beneficiary or not. If the doses for next rounds are already provided, the distributor can mark next doses as 'Delivered' for the next rounds.

**Step 5:** Once the User Presses on Next Button in the Previous Screen the user is taken to  the "Data Recorded Successfully" screen which has 2 buttons. "View Household Details" button would take the user to Household Details page of the household for which the distributor recorded the data. "Back to Search" button will take the Distributor to the "Search Individual" Screen to search for beneficiaries from other families.&#x20;

You can choose "Yes" or "No" with a table below that shows the dosage to be provided for the upcoming cycles. Click on 'Next'.

In Step 4 of recording the multi-round campaign process, based on the response provided by you for the question "Did you provide Drugs for the next Doses?" the screens for next round of delivery in a given cycle will be as follows:

**If you replied Yes:** If you replied 'Yes', the next time you visit the beneficiary and click on "Record Delivery" against that beneficiary in the household details page, you will see the following screen:

Once you submit the answers for the above questions, you can record the side-effects for a beneficiary by clicking on 'Yes' If no side-effects were reported, select 'No' to move on to the beneficiary details screen, and the delivery status for all cycles will show as 'Completed'.

**If you replied No:** If you selected "No" in Step 4, for recording the next dose, you will start again from the household details page. Click on the "Record Delivery" button and follow the same flow as for the first round of drug delivery.
