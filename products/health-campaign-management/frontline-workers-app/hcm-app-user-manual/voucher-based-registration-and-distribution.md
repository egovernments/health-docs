# Voucher-Based Registration and Distribution

With the help of Voucher-Based Registration and Distribution, the registrar can use a QR code-based voucher provided by the programme to link beneficiaries to the QR code  voucher at the time of registration. This will enable distributors to search for beneficiaries at the time of delivery by scanning the QR code vouchers linked to a specific beneficiary.

## Key Features

* Allows a registrar to link a QR code voucher provided by the programme to the beneficiary by scanning the QR code at the time of registration.
* Allows a distributor to search for a beneficiary in the system by scanning the QR code voucher shown by the beneficiary when the Distributor has to deliver the drug.
