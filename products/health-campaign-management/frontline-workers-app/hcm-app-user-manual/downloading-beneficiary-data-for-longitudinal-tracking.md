# Downloading Beneficiary Data for Longitudinal Tracking

This feature allows the distributors to download all the boundary data along with data for beneficiaries which will be covered by the distributor on a given day of a campaign. For this process, the distributor must select all the levels of boundary data till the lowest level of boundary hierarchy so that he/she only needs to download limited data at one go, which would aid for device memory and data bandwidth constraints.

## Key Features

* Distributor has to select the boundary hierarchy to the lowest level and then download the latest beneficiary data from the server to start their drug delivery.
* Once the data is found, the data can be downloaded and the distributor can choose to download data for other boundaries if they plan to use it.
* This feature can only be done in areas where a stable internet connection is available.

## Steps to Download Beneficiary Data for Longitudinal Tracking

**Step 1**

When you login to the app, you will arrive on the "Boundary Selection" screen once the micro-planning data is synced. You will have to select all hierarchies of boundary till the last level of boundary hierarchy before you can click on 'Submit' and download any data onto your devices.

**Step 2**

Once you click on 'Submit', the app checks with the server if the selected boundary has any new data associated with it which needs to be downloaded on to the device. If new data is found, the following screen will appear and you click the 'Download' button or click on "Proceed without downloading" the data.
