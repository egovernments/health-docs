# Introducing DIGIT Health Platform

## Mission

Help countries achieve Health SDGs by building digital public goods that strengthen public health.

## Overview

The health mission at eGov aims to expand capabilities in public health. The focus is on two aspects: one is to help countries reduce “diseases of poverty.” The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that such diseases “account for 45% of the disease burden in the poorest countries” and stem from poor nutrition and sanitation, absence of health education, and indoor air pollution. We want to help countries reduce this by building digital tools on top of eGov’s open-source platform - the Digital Infrastructure for Governance, Impact & Transformation (DIGIT) - to enable and manage health campaigns, and disease surveillance.&#x20;

Another focus is to improve trust in health transactions through public health credentialing. We are already doing this via the Digital Infrastructure for Verifiable Open Credentialing (DIVOC). We are currently expanding health credentialing as a service.&#x20;

## **DIGIT Health Platform Principles**

* Re-usable: Shared data registries
* Interoperable: Open API specifications
* Scalable
* Secure
* Multi-country support: Support for infrastructure isolation, as well as data isolation
* Multi-lingual: Support for multiple languages

## **Health Campaign Management (HCM) Overview**

Health risks such as infectious diseases generally cannot be addressed at the individual and health worker levels alone. This is where public health campaigns come into the picture. The COVID-19 pandemic has also created an opportunity to rethink how we can better plan, and execute public health campaigns. It has brought the need to design more effective campaigns that can reach difficult-to-access areas or communities, particularly in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs).

Public health campaigns are specific, time-bound health services that respond to specific challenges and are provided to a target population by dedicated campaign workers. Such campaigns can influence perceptions, attitudes, and behaviours to achieve the desired goal. They can be used to prevent or respond to disease outbreaks, control or eliminate targeted diseases, or achieve other health objectives.

According to a [**study**](https://gh.bmj.com/content/6/11/e006397), “over 530 health campaigns were planned for 26 different interventions, representing 13 diseases and 105 countries” in 2020. However, by the end of 2020, an estimated 50% of the public health campaigns were postponed, suspended, or canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This left millions of people and children at risk of vaccine-preventable diseases and malnutrition.

As health campaigns catch up on missed vaccinations, drugs, and other preventative measures globally, the health mission has an opportunity to reimagine the way countries can plan and implement campaigns through an open-source digital platform. We believe that designing and developing a health campaign platform will enable countries, communities, and healthcare professionals to manage and implement more effective and impactful programmes.&#x20;

## **Disease Surveillance Overview**

Disease surveillance is an ongoing and systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data, which is critical to planning, evaluating, and implementing health practices, policies, and programmes.

According to the [**World Health Organisation (WHO)**](https://www.who.int/emergencies/surveillance), disease surveillance data is meant to:

* Serve as an early warning system for impending outbreaks that could become public health emergencies.
* Enable monitoring and evaluation of the impact of an intervention, as well as help track progress toward specific goals.
* Monitor and clarify the epidemiology of health problems, guide priority-setting and planning, as well as evaluate public health policy and strategies.

eGov’s health mission aims to create a disease surveillance platform in the future that will enable decision-makers and public health personnel to make informed decisions, take timely action, facilitate faster decision-making, and improve public health surveillance outcomes.&#x20;
