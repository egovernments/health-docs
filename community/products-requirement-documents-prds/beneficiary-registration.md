## Background

This document describes the need and scope of a digital platform for health campaigns, explaining the product’s features, specifications, purpose, and functionality for beneficiary registration. It also provides a descriptive view of the application along with the specification of each element within the flow.

## Target Audience

The document is intended for the engineering and platform (tech teams), product management, and implementation teams to agree on the requirements for the Health Campaign Management Platform (HCM).

## Objectives (of this release)

1. To enable actors with a digital system to manage and implement health campaign activities.&#x20;

&#x20;      a. Facilitate FLWs, supervisors, district officers, and other actors to collect and analyse data accurately, along with monitoring registration tasks. Regular progress checks can also be performed at any time and a comparative analysis can be derived at the district levels for different teams in terms of beneficiaries registered.

2. To increase the adoption of the HCM platform for multiple health campaigns by providing flexibility in the UI and UX as well as product specifications.

&#x20;      a. Emphasis on adopting digital systems by collaborating with several healthcare initiative bodies.

&#x20;      b. Provide scope for future changes and improvements in the upcoming versions of the application.
