## Background

This document describes the need and scope of a digital platform for health campaigns, explaining the productâ€™s features, specifications, purpose, and functionality. It also provides a descriptive view of the application along with the specification of each element.

The module focuses on the design and features of the user interface of HCM for beneficiary registration and service delivery. It provides a detailed description of the elements and the process flow of the application along with a wireframe model for easier comprehension. The module also aims to reduce the risks of data redundancy, provide better service delivery tracking, and visibility of the services provided for maximum coverage in the quickest time possible

## Target Audience&#x20;

The document is intended for the engineering and platform (tech teams), product management, and implementation teams to agree on requirements for the Health Campaign Management (HCM) Platform.

## Objectives (of this release)

1\. To enable actors with a digital system to manage and implement health campaign activities.&#x20;

a. Facilitate FLWs, supervisors, district officers, and other actors to collect and analyse data accurately, along with monitoring the tasks from registration to service delivery. Regular progress checks can be performed at any time and a comparative analysis can be derived at the district levels for different teams.&#x20;

b. Facilitate better diagnostics with improved access to healthcare interventions for the general public.&#x20;

2\. To enhance the adoption of the HCM platform for multiple health campaigns by providing flexibility in the UI and UX, and product specifications.&#x20;

a. Emphasis on adopting digital systems by collaborating with healthcare bodies.&#x20;

b. Provide scope for future changes and improvements in the application.
