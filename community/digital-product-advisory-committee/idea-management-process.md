# Idea Management Process

## Introduction

This document outlines a systematic approach to manage and evaluate new ideas for product development coming from the members of the DPAC. It is meant to serve as a guide for product managers to effectively assess and decide whether to implement these ideas into the product.

## Process Overview

#### Step 1: Idea Submission and Documentation

The DPAC members are encouraged to use the [Idea submission form](https://forms.gle/M3RABxBBRNTHRtFN6) to submit new ideas which will be documented in a central repository.&#x20;

#### **Step 2: Initial Review**

All submitted ideas will undergo a preliminary review to check alignment with the overall goal, outcomes, problem addressed and the productâ€™s roadmap. Any idea that does not align with the strategic objectives of the product will be dropped after deliberation with the DPAC.

#### **Step 3: Prioritisation and Feasibility Analysis**

The remaining ideas that pass the preliminary review are then prioritised based on their potential to solve a specific problem and deliver impact on the ground.
