Name is mandatory field. It is suggested to add all the details in the form. But if the other details are not available then the member can be added only by name. Fill the rest of the details for atleast one member in each household. For example, if there are 3 members in a household, as part of UAT, please fill in all the details in atleast one member, you can skip filling the other details other than names for the rest. <br>2. It is not mandatory to add details or add members to each household. The number of members in a household is enough for the bed nets to be distributed. As part of UAT, we ask you to add members to each household.</p> | 1.
