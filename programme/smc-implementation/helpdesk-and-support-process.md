# Helpdesk and Support Process

## Overview&#x20;

The Ministry of Health(MISAU) in Mozambique is implementing the Health Campaign Management (DIGIT-HCM) platform in Mozambique with support from eGov. A helpdesk has been proposed to receive, log, prioritise, assign, track, escalate, and resolve hardware and software-related issues raised during the campaign which impede campaign operations.

The helpdesk team will be based in Nampula to ensure easier coordination with the provincial teams who are responsible for distribution. For resolving technical issues or queries in the Salama (DIGIT-HCM) platform, there will be 1-2 members from eGov based in Mozambique to support the helpdesk staff of MISAU. eGov will set up a remote support team (also referred to as level 3 support), located in Bangalore, to resolve issues that the local helpdesk team in the Nampula is unable to resolve. The helpdesk will become operational a few days before the start of the actual drug (sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine or SPAQ) distribution activities as proposed by the NMCP and will remain operational for a few days after the distribution.&#x20;

The helpdesk will operate between 6.00 am till midnight (12.00 am) Mozambique time (CAT) and a roster needs to be maintained for the entire duration for the local team (Layer 2 support in Mozambique) as well as the remote support team (Layer 3 team based in Bangalore).&#x20;

### Scope of the Helpdesk Support

* Technical support on hardware and software (for Salama- DIGIT HCM platform only).
* Resolution of general how-to queries relating to the Salama platform with the help of a FAQ document that may arise from the field.
* User management: Creation of the users (named users who access the platform using their individual usernames and passwords) using the user management module of the Salama platform, and helping the field users with the required information if they forget the user names or passwords.
* Master data management: Uploading the master data in the platform and updates to Master data if the list of villages change during the campaign.

Examples of the queries to be handled by the helpdesk:&#x20;

1. Issues with the application or the dashboard functioning.
2. Login or password not working or forgotten.
3. Creating new users, if any, due to field staff getting changed during the campaign.
4. Updating new localities or villages in the system during the campaign.

## Operational/Programmatic Queries

The operational/programmatic queries received by the helpdesk will be redirected to NMCP officials by the level 2 support team.

Examples of operational or programmatic queries (to be routed to NMCP):

1. Not having sufficient stock of drugs.
2. Not receiving the device or any loss of device in the field.
3. SPAQ quality issues.
4. Logistic issues related to the distribution of SPAQ.&#x20;
5. Any issues relating to the SPAQ distribution process as outlined by the NMCP.

## Helpdesk Workflow

The typical lifecycle of a helpdesk ticket starts when an issue is received and ends when a ticket gets closed. The below representation shows how the helpdesk ticketing management system will work. In this representation:&#x20;

* The WhatsApp groups of registrars, LMs and district supervisors will play the role of level 1 support.
* The helpdesk team based in Nampula will play the role of level 2 support.
* eGov technical support team (based in India) will play the role of level 3 support.
*   For the issues which are not related to scope of the helpdesk, the helpdesk team will redirect the issue (over call/ WhatsApp) to concerned NMCP officials for further communication and resolution.

#### **Raising Tickets**

The helpdesk staff will use the grievance portal (complaints module of the Salama app) to record every incident or grievance that is reported to them. The helpdesk staff will  be able to login with a dedicated user ID and password and log a complaint by raising a ticket against it. The login credentials will be generated from the backend and provided to the identified users.

## Modes of Communication

Phone calls & WhatsApp messaging:

It has been observed from the previous campaigns that users in the field (that is, the distribution teams) often reach out to the local monitors (LMs) and district supervisors for simpler queries over a phone call or WhatsApp communication for quick resolution of their queries. This is deemed as the level 1 support in this document. The district supervisors escalate more complex issues to the helpdesk team again, over phone calls or WhatsApp group communication. Usually the provincial focal points create a WhatsApp group during provincial ToTs and add the relevant members. The same approach would be followed for the SMC campaign in Nampula When the issue gets escalated from district supervisors over a phone call or WhatsApp message, the helpdesk team (level 2 team) will record them in the complaints management tool.

## Ticket categories

Following categories of incidents are envisaged to be logged at the helpdesk. Each incident category will have its independent process of resolution as defined in the SOP section of this document.

Level 2 helpdesk operating dates and timings in the Nampula.

The helpdesk will be operational for the below mentioned duration.

Dates: Starting from 7-Aug-23 till the end of the SPAQ distribution.

Mozambique: 6:00 am – 12.00 am CAT (midnight).

## Ticket Tracking

The primary goal of the helpdesk is to restore normal operations at the earliest possible, and with a minimum impact.&#x20;

Critical app-related issues that cannot be resolved within the campaign duration will be shared with eGov which will be picked up immediately after the campaign for review and resolution.

Enhancements (major and minor) will go through a change request process. Due to the nature of the project, there will be no feature updates to the DIGIT system during the campaign period. Any updates to the HCM application during the campaign window  will be avoided as far as possible because it may be difficult to push the updates to all the devices and there may be data loss due to the same.&#x20;
