## Scenarios

### Registration:

1. Register 5 households residing in a village A in Tete. You must capture the address details, capture how many numbers are living in the household, and fill in details (age, gender, mobile number) for at least 1 member living in the household. The first member you register in the household must be the head of the household. Then you proceed to deliver bed nets:-

&#x20;     a. Which is less than the number of bed nets suggested by the App for 2 households

&#x20;     b. Which is more than the number of bed nets suggested by the App for 1 household

&#x20;     c. Which is same as the number of bed nets suggested by the App for 2 households

2. You realise that you made a mistake while registering one member and want to go correct your mistake. Search for a household head you have registered which has individual members added. The mistake was in the mobile number- change the mobile number you entered previously with a new mobile number.&#x20;
3. As a distributor you are required to do the distribution in village B. Change the location from Village A to Village B and register 2  households. This time add only the household head and no individual members in the household. Also, skip adding the Landmark in the household details page and skip adding mobile number, age, gender while registering the household head. Deliver the exact number of bed nets as suggested by the app.
4. Search for a household you have delivered. You entered the household head for person A. But when you visited the household again, you needed to change the household head to another person.  How will you do it?
5. Search for a household you have delivered. Now, delete a member from a household that you have delivered. How will you do it?
6. For one the deliveries recorded, you realise you entered an incorrect number of bed nets. Instead of 2, you recorded 3. How will you correct the mistake?
7. Sync all the records pending to be synced in the application.
8. You are a registador and you forgot your password. What will you do?
9. You are not able to see your assigned village in the list of villages. What action would you take?
