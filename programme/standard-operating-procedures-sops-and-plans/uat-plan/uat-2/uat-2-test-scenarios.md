## Scenarios

### Registration & Distribution:

1. Register 5 households residing in a village in Zambezia. Capture how many numbers are living in the household, and fill in details (age, gender, mobile number) for the head of the household. Then you proceed to deliver bed nets:

&#x20;      a. Which is less than the number of bed nets suggested by the app for 2 households

&#x20;      b. Which is more than the number of bed nets suggested by the app for 1 household

&#x20;      c. Which is same as the number of bed nets suggested by the app for 2 households

2. As a distributor, you are required to do the distribution in another village than the one you did prior. Change the village and register 2 households. This time, skip adding the landmark in the household details page. Deliver the exact number of bed nets as suggested by the app.
3. You realise that you made a mistake while registering one member and want to  correct your mistake. Search for a household head you have registered which has individual members added. First, correct the household head details by changing the age. Next, change the mobile number you entered previously with a new mobile number.&#x20;
4. You are a registador and you forgot your password. What will you do?
5. You are not able to see your assigned village in the list of villages. What action will you take?
6. You are a registador and you realise that one of the members you registered has already been registered by your colleague and is a duplicate entry. What will you do to remove the duplicate entry from your records?
7. Sync all the records pending to be synced in the application.

### Supervision:&#x20;

1. You are the supervisor for the team working in village A in Zambezia, and your team members are in the field distributing nets. As per protocol, you are expected to go and observe them work and record your observations in the Registration and Distribution checklist. Fill out the checklist and submit your observations for the following checklists. Mark ‘No’ as a response for at least 2 questions in each checklist and provide the reasons.
