# Monitoring and Evaluation (M\&E) Tools

The M\&E for Mozambique is currently being conducted by CHAI. The focus of the M\&E is to evaluate between DHIS2 and DIGIT. &#x20;

To conntextualise the indicators and data collected during all M\&E facets of the Mozambique LLIN strategy, a logic model for the CCU was developed, and is reproduced below:&#x20;

### Logic model for Mozambique LLIN 2022-2023 CCU (from M\&E plan, Aug 2022):&#x20;

The model was developed to be applicable to the tool comparison portion of M\&E, though its specific deliverable will differ from those produced until now.

### M\&E products for LLIN distribution during Groups 4 and 5:

A minimum of three products are expected following distribution in Group 4 and in Group 5:

1. A report on the training of trainers for Group 4, that includes considerations on a range of planning processes (micro-planning, changes to platform, training results, recommendations):

&#x20;      \- More qualitative in character, the report focuses on output 1.2 of the logic model above.

2. A standard province group M\&E report, as done for previous distributions in the 22-23 cycle, summarising campaign results (typically at the district, block, and province level):

&#x20;      \- This report communicates results on approximately 30 indicators split across different categories, as shown in the figure below:

The focus of these indicators leans more towards Output 1.4, Outcome 2.1, Outcome 2.2 and Impact 3.1 shown in the Logic Model above.

3. A tool C mparison M\&E report specifically assessing the performance of the DHIS2 and DIGIT tools during the CCU.

&#x20;      \- The deployment of different tools provides an opportunity to examine how each tool works and how each is received by stakeholders of the CCU. The current file aims to introduce the methodology to be followed in the tool comparison report, as the original M\&E plan outlined its necessity, but did not discuss it in substance. In particular, this analysis means the deployment of further indicators split across two broad categories:

&#x20;    a. System indicators will deal with the technical aspects of the tools - how well they function and if they meet the data solution requirements. These will link to Output 1.1 of the logic model.

&#x20;   b. Users and usability indicators will collect information on how users engage with each tool, as well as the feedback on how satisfied they felt. These will link, mainly, to Outputs 1.2 and 1.3 of the logic model.&#x20;

Despite the tools themselves being outputs of the Mozambique LLIN M\&E strategy, it will be important to showcase results of their use on the outcomes and impact of the campaign. As such, some key indicators from the provincial report will also be included in the tool comparison report. These will be summarised at the DHIS2 provinces versus DIGIT province level, or will compare Manica versus Sofala versus Tete results as appropriate for each indicator. Hence, the tool comparison M\&E report will be built as follows:
