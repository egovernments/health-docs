# DevOps Skills Requirements

## Hiring DevOps Resources <a href="#hiring-devops-resources" id="hiring-devops-resources"></a>

Anyone involved in hiring DevOps engineers will realise that it is hard to find prospective candidates who have all the skills listed in this section. Ultimately, the skill set needed for an incoming DevOps engineer would depend on the current and short-term focus of the operations team. A brand new team that is rolling out a new software service would require someone with good experience in infrastructure provisioning, deployment automation, and monitoring.&#x20;

A team that supports a stable product might require the service of an expert who could migrate home-grown automation projects to tools and processes around standard configuration management and continuous integration tools.

DevOps practice is a glue between engineering disciplines. An experienced DevOps engineer would end up working in a very broad swath of technology landscapes that overlaps with software development, system integration, and operations engineering.

An experienced DevOps engineer would be able to describe most of the technologies that is described in the following sections. This is a comprehensive list of DevOps skills for comparing oneâ€™s expertise and a reference template for acquiring new skills.

In theory, a template like this should be used only for assessing the current experience of a prospective hire. The needed skills can be picked up on the jobs that demand deep knowledge in certain areas. Therefore, the focus should be to hire smart engineers who have a track record of picking up new skills, rolling out innovative projects at work, and contributing to reputed open-source projects.

### 1. Knowledge of Infrastructure <a href="#1.-knowledge-of-infrastructure" id="1.-knowledge-of-infrastructure"></a>

### 3. System Tools and Methods <a href="#3.-system-tools-and-methods" id="3.-system-tools-and-methods"></a>

To get an automation project up and running, a DevOps engineer builds new things such as configuration objects in an application and code snippets of full-blown programs. However, a major part of the work is glueing many things together at the system level on the given infrastructure. Such efforts are not different from traditional system integration work and, in my opinion, the ingenuity of an engineer at this level determines his or her real value on the team. It is easy to find cookbooks, recipes, and best practices for vendor-supported tools, but it would take experience working on diverse projects to gain the necessary skill set to implement robust integrations that have to work reliably in production.Important system-level tools and techniques are listed here. The engineer should have knowledge about the following.

### **Access Management** <a href="#access-management" id="access-management"></a>

### Programming Primer for DevOps <a href="#programming-primer-for-devops" id="programming-primer-for-devops"></a>

One of the attributes that helps differentiate a DevOps engineer from other members in the operations team, like sysadmins, DBAs, and operations support staff, is his or her ability to write code. The coding and scripting skill is just one of the tools in the DevOps toolbox, but it's a powerful one that a DevOps engineer would maintain as part of practising his or her trade.Coding is the last resort when things cannot be integrated by configuring and tweaking the applications and tools that are used in an automation project.

### **Scripting** <a href="#scripting" id="scripting"></a>

#### **Bash Scripting Essentials** <a href="#bash-scripting-essentials" id="bash-scripting-essentials"></a>

Many times, a few lines of bash script could be the best glue code integrating two components in the whole software system. DevOps engineer should have basic shell scripting skills and Bash is the most popular right now.

#### **Python** <a href="#python" id="python"></a>

If a script has to deal with external systems and components or it's more than just a few lines of command-lines and dealing with fairly complex logic, it might be better to write that script in an advanced scripting language like Python, Perl, or Ruby.Knowledge of Python would make your life easier when dealing with DevOps applications such as Ansible, which uses Python syntax to define data structures and implement conditionals for defining configurations.

#### **Web Programming** <a href="#web-programming" id="web-programming"></a>

One of the categories of projects a DevOps engineer would end up doing is building dashboards. Though dashboarding features are found with most of the DevOps tools, those are specific to the application, and there will be a time when you may require to have a general-purpose dashboard with more dynamic content than just static links and text.Another requirement is to build web UI for provisioning tools to present those as self-service tools to user groups.In both these cases, deep web programming skills are not required. Knowledge of a web programming friendly language such as PHP and a JavaScript/CSS/HTML library like Composer would be enough to get things started. It is also important for the DevOps engineer to know the full-stack, in this case, LAMP, for building and running the web apps.

#### **Configuration Languages** <a href="#configuration-languages" id="configuration-languages"></a>

Almost every application and tool that is used for building, deploying, and maintaining software systems use configuration files. While manual reading of these files might not require any expertise, a DevOps engineer should know how config files in such formats are created and parsed programmatically.A DevOps engineer should have a good understanding of these formats:

* INI.
* XML.
* JSON.
* YAML.

The engineer should also know how these formats are parsed in his/her favourite scripting language.

### **REST API** <a href="#rest-api" id="rest-api"></a>

The wide acceptance of REST API as a standard to expose features that other applications can use for system integration made it a feature requirement for any application that wants to be taken seriously. The knowledge of using REST API has become an important skill for DevOps engineer.

* **HTTP/HTTPS:** REST APIs are based on HTTP/HTTPS protocol and a solid understanding of its working is required. Knowledge of HTTP headers, status codes, and main verbs GET, POST, and PUT.
* **REST API basics:** Normal layout of APIs defined for an application.
* **Curl and Wget**: Command-line tools to access REST API and HTTP URLs. Some knowledge of the support available for HTTP protocol in scripting languages will be useful and that would be an indication of working with REST APIs.
* **Authentication methods:** Cookie-based and OAuth authentication; API keys; use of If-Match and If-None-Match set of HTTP headers for updates.
* **API management tools:** If the application you support provides an API for the users, most probably, its usage will be managed by some API Gateway tool. Though not an essential skill, experience in this area would be good if one works on the API provider side.

### **Programming With Data Repositories** <a href="#programming-with-data-repositories" id="programming-with-data-repositories"></a>

There was a time when mere knowledge of programming with RDBMS was enough for an application developer and system integrator to manage application data. Now with the wide adoption of Big Data platform like Hadoop and NOSQL systems to process and store data, a DevOps engineer needs varied requirements, from one project to another. Core skills are the following:

* **RDBMS:** MySQL, Postgres, etc. knowledge of one or more is important.
* **Setting up and configuring PostGres:** As an open-source database used with many other tools in the DevOps toolchain, consider this as a basic requirement for a DevOps engineer. If one hasnâ€™t done this, he or she might not have done enough yet.
* **Running queries from a Bash script:** How to run a database query via a database client from a Bash script and use the output. MySQL is a good example.
* **Database access from Perl/PHP/Python:** All the major scripting languages provide modules to access databases and that can be used to write robust automation scripts. Examples are Perl DBI and Pythonâ€™s MySQLdb module.
* **DB Backups:** Migration, Logging, monitoring and cleanup.

### **Programming for Cloud** <a href="#programming-for-cloud" id="programming-for-cloud"></a>

Those who have built cloud infrastructure with a focus on automation and versioning should know some of these (or similar) tools:

* **cloud-init:** Cloud-init can be used to configure a virtual machine when it is spun up. This is very useful when a node is spun up from a machine image with baseline or even application software already baked in.
* **AWS/Azure/GCloud CLI:** If the application runs on Commercial cloud, knowledge of CLI is needed, which would be handy to put together simple automation scripts.
* **Terraform:** HashiCorpâ€™s Terraform is an important tool if the focus would be to provision infrastructure as code (IaaS). Using this, infrastructure can be configured independently of the target cloud or virtualization platform.
* **Ansible:** It can be used to build machine images for a variety of virtualization technologies and cloud platforms, it is useful if the infrastructure is provisioned in a mixed or hybrid cloud environment.

### **Error Handling** <a href="#error-handling" id="error-handling"></a>

In a rush to get things rolled out, one of the things left half-done is adding enough error handling in scripts. Automation scripts that are not robust can cause major production issues, which could impact the credibility of DevOps efforts itself. A DevOps engineer should be aware of the following best practices in error handling and logging:

* The importance of error handling in automated scripts.
* Error handling in Bash.
* Error handling in Python.
* Logging errors in application and system logs.
