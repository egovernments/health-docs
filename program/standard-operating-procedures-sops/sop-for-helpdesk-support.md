# SOP for Helpdesk Support

## Overview

The NMCP is implementing the Health Campaign Management (DIGIT-HCM) platform in Mozambique with support from eGov and CHAI. A helpdesk has been proposed to receive, log, prioritise, assign, track, escalate, resolve hardware and software-related issues raised during the campaign which impede campaign operations. &#x20;

The helpdesk team will be based in Maputo, Mozambique. For resolving technical issues or queries in the DIGIT-HCM app, there will be 1-2 members from eGov based in Mozambique to support the helpdesk. eGov will also set up a remote support team to resolve issues that the local helpdesk is unable to resolve.&#x20;

As it will be a limited duration (i.e. 3-4 days) campaign, the helpdesk will become operational from the registrar training until the end of the campaign, during the business hours of Mozambique.

#### Scope of the helpdesk

* User management
* Master data management
* Technical support on hardware and software (DIGIT)

#### Out of scope of helpdesk

* Resolving programmatic issues related to bed net distribution. The operational/programmatic queries received by the helpdesk will be redirected to NMCP officials.

#### Helpdesk Workflow

The typical lifecycle of a helpdesk ticket starts when an issue is received and ends when a ticket gets closed. The below representation shows how the helpdesk ticketing management system will work:

For the issues which are not related to scope of the helpdesk, Help desk team will redirect the issue (over call/ WhatsApp) to concerned NMCP officials for further communication and resolution.

#### Raising Tickets

The helpdesk staff will use the Grievance portal (Complaints Module) to record every incident or grievance. The help desk staff would be able to login with dedicated User ID and Password and log a complaint by raising a ticket against it. The login credentials will be generated from the backend and provided to the identified users.

## Modes Of Communication&#x20;

A user can communicate with the helpdesk in multiple ways as described below:

1\. Phone Number:

The helpdesk executives will manage dedicated landline/phone numbers wherein a user can call and log issues. Any call made at the helpdesk shall be logged in the ticketing system along with the action taken and solution provided. Helpdesk Dial-in: xxxxxxxxxx. Provisioning of the helpdesk number will be managed by CHAI.

2\. WhatsApp

The WhatsApp group can also get created for the users by the local monitors for the distributors mapped under him. For initial support, the distributor can use the WhatApp group to report the issue or support request. The local monitor can resolve the query or escalate it to get reported in the Feedback/Grievance portal.&#x20;

3\. Logging an issue in the DIGIT app: If the field team raises an issue in the offline app, they can be visible in the helpdesk portal when the user has internet connection

## Support Levels

Three levels of support will be set up at the helpdesk for query resolution. A hierarchy will be set for resolving the queries with a provision to escalate to the next higher level as per the nature of the query and intervention required. The helpdesk support levels are described as below:

| S.No. | Levels                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Helpdesk Operating Hours

The normal business hours for the helpdesk will be:

Mozambique: 8:00 AM – 11.00 PM CAT

India: 10:00AM – 02:30 AM IST (Post midnight)

## Resolution Time

The primary goal of the helpdesk is to restore normal operations at the earliest possible, and with a minimum impact.&#x20;

Critical app-related issues that cannot be resolved within the campaign duration will be shared with eGov which will be picked up immediately after the campaign for the second round of pilot in Group V.&#x20;

Enhancements (major and minor) will go through a change request process. Due to the nature of the project, there will be no feature updates to the DIGIT system during the campaign period.&#x20;

#### Tools for the helpdesk team

What do they need to be effective?

* FAQ on issues commonly-faced
* Training on user management and complaints portal
* User manual on DIGIT app
* User manual on complaints portal & user management
* Videos that they can share?

## Helpdesk Team Roles and Responsibilities

The helpdesk team will have following profiles

1. Helpdesk operations manager
2. Helpdesk executives
3. eGov onsite support team
4. Programme nodal officers (for programmatic queries) from NMCP

The helpdesk operations manager will:&#x20;

\- Have access to all open tickets and maintain operational control over the helpdesk. He/she shall ensure that the helpdesk functions as per the defined rules. In addition to this, the helpdesk operations manager will also be responsible for the management of the ticketing software. He/she will be able to perform the following functions on the tickets:

* Log a new ticket.
* Provide any comments/updates on a ticket.
* Upload any supporting document related to the ticket.
* Forward the ticket to the relevant categories/levels.
* Close the ticket .
* This user will also have the rights to create, modify and delete users in the helpdesk system.
* Update and maintain the knowledge management system of the helpdesk.&#x20;

The helpdesk executive will:&#x20;

* Log in and resolve complaints.&#x20;
* In case they need eGov’s support, they will assign the tickets to eGov.
* Once resolved or closed, they will inform the local supervisor or user as appropriate.

## For discussion/Open questions

1. Will the helpdesk staff be able to record the issues in the complaints tool in English?
2. What would be the process for operational/non-tech issue resolution since the helpdesk will get all sorts of queries. Are there programme people from NMCP as part of the helpdesk? There needs to be standard responses from the helpdesk personnel to redirect the callers to the right person. What would that response be?
3. It has been assumed that a helpline number for queries being reported over the calls to the helpdesk. Please confirm if this is correct?
4. Can the help desk have a WhatsApp number or it would be a call centre number such as 100/101? We are assuming that email will not be a mode of communication between users and the  helpdesk team, i.e., complaints will neither be reported over mail nor the resolution informed over mail. Once an issue has been resolved, the helpdesk staff will call the reporter and inform them about the fix.
5. It is assumed that help desk issues and calls from distribution teams will typically happen only when the teams return to their base locations and are under network coverage area.
6. The tickets that get assigned to the L3 support team staffed by eGov , will be recorded in the complaints module, and the eGov team will update status in this same tool.&#x20;
7. CHAI will have to share the details of the helpdesk support staff with eGov for creating their logins.
8. What would happen if the issue is not possible to resolve within the campaign period, assuming no software upgrades will be possible during this period?
9. We are assuming the helpdesk will also coordinate the changes or updates in master data? Is this assumption correct?
10. We are assuming that the helpdesk staff will also handle user provisioning (i.e., the creation of new users accounts). Is this assumption correct?
11. Do we need a complaints report to be built in the complaints module to get the list of complaints assigned to eGov or other parties to do a daily triage?
12. How long will the helpdesk team remain operational? That is: &#x20;

&#x20;       \- For how many days ?

&#x20;       \- Does it become active before actual campaign distribution?

&#x20;       \- Does it remain active after the distribution is over?

&#x20;       \- How many hours each day?

14. Are the nodal officers from NMCP, who are going to address the operational queries, going to be part of the helpdesk. If yes, in what capacity ?
15. Do we need to log the operational queries at all in the complaints tool? Because if we do so, we may need to also update the resolution which would be provided by NMCP staff.
16. Will the helpdesk be common for Tete and other provinces? If yes , then how many of the helpdesk support staff would be allocated for Tete? Will one person receive the queries/issues for more than one province?\
