## Training Assets

These assets will be put to use at various stages of the training and will act as learning aids for the trainees.

1. Powerpoint presentations
2. FAQs
3. User manuals

B. All the reference material will be provided in a soft format. Printing of the reference material will be handled by the NMCP.

C. (Nice to have) Short length demo videos (sub-titled) that can be circulated via mediums like Whatsapp and used at any time, will be provided. These could be used by master trainers as well as other users.

## Training plan (Pre go-live - Before the campaign begins)

#### Training Prerequisites

Following are the list of prerequisites to conduct the training at all the levels:

1. Training material in English and Portuguese in digital and printed formats.
2. Identification of trainees and trainers at the national, provincial, local monitor, and registrar levels before the training dates.
3. Creation of users (login access) in the system for the training.
4. Logistic arrangements for training:

&#x20;      a. Training venue/hall with computers/laptops and internet connectivity with a capacity of hosting 15-20 persons.&#x20;

&#x20;     b. Travel and accommodation for trainees and trainers.&#x20;

&#x20;     c. Big screen TV.

&#x20;     d. Projector.

&#x20;     e. Refreshments and other basic amenities for trainers and trainees.

&#x20;     f. Mobile phones provisioned with HCM apk for the selected trainers and trainees till national/provincial users, supervisors and local monitors (\~200).

5. Training instance setup in the cloud.

#### During the campaign:

How will  users that join after training is completed be trained?

## Questions for CHAI

1. At which level/training are the warehouse users getting trained? Does it happen with central ToT or provincial ToT or Local Monitor trainings?&#x20;
2. Does the training assets need to be reviewed by NMCP?
3. Central ToT:&#x20;

&#x20;      a. Does eGov need to train the CHAI identified master trainers before Central ToT?

&#x20;      b. What are the venues for central ToT, provincial ToT and other training?

&#x20;      c. Confirm the number of trainees at the national level.

&#x20;      d. What languages have been used during the central ToT in the past?&#x20;

&#x20;      e. During central ToT, the app will have manual sync. eGov’s training material will be based on this.

&#x20;     f. During ToTs, how much time would be available to the eGov team for training the participants on the HCM application?

&#x20;     g. Given that two provinces are going to use DHIS2 and one will use DIGIT, how will the structure of the ToTs change?

4. Do we have a mapping of operational SOPs to the training type (for example, in which training SOPs on user management should be covered)? Is there any existing document on Operational SOP?
5. The reference material will be provided in the soft format. Printing of the reference material will be handled by the CHAI/NMCP. Is this assumption correct?
6. Sequence of training due to multiple product releases:

&#x20;      a. Since product drops are happening in three phases, how do we plan for training outside the purview of ToTs? We will need to train the master trainers on remaining product features like user management and parts of the dashboard sometime after central ToT and before provincial ToT. Is that a right assumption?

&#x20;     b. When are we training the helpdesk team given that the complaints module will be developed first and then helpdesk staff will be identified and trained? Here it is assumed that training for L1 helpdesk would be done by CHAI/WV as it needs to be imparted in the local language.

&#x20;     c. When are the NMCP folks trained for user management? Since the user management module will be developed after central ToT, it is assumed that there would be another training session between central and provincial ToTs.

7. Should we plan for short-length videos in Portuguese? Will it make a difference and be effective in aligning the users? Will field users be able to find these videos in the local file system and use them? For which level of user would videos be most beneficial?
8. The CHAI team will take care of the training content addressing areas like how to use mobile phones. This content can be re-used from previous campaigns.
